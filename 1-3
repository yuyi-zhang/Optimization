## How to model portfolio optimization model?
Elective1: Mean-variance model > minimize the risk which > subject to expected return should be larger than the required lower limit 
Elective2: Mean absolute deviation model > minimize expected |portfolio return - average portfolio model| > subject to expected return should be higher than the limit
Elective3: Naive diversification > equally devide the budget among several risky options 


##case1 
Target: 
1. How to select one or more suppliers 
decide the purchase product of each supplier 
Constraints: 
1. administrative cost of 7000 for each of the suppliers. Total administrative cost 7000xnumber of suppliers 
2. for reliability, no supplier can sullpy more than 80% of the demand of any product 
3. must supply an integer amount of each product 
Objective: 
minimize(purchase + administration cost)


////////////////Data modeling and decisions under uncertainty///////
---------------what if analysis----------------
## how to make decision without complete information or have no informatin at all
 1. credit card payment 
 a. design your monthly payment strategy 
 b. develop a spreadsheet functions to simplify the banlance from one month to the next (base model)
 c. use spreadsheet functions to simplify the balance calculations from one month to the next
 [ending balance]= [current balance]x(1+monthly interest rate)-[payment]
 q: what is the total paymeny for the 24 months?
 
 >assume a base strategy > calculate the data using the base strategy 
 >now change the important input parameter (one more change)
 1. change the maximum monthly payment > use the data table (if more than 2 factors, not concenient/ simply recalculate outputs)
 2. change 2 main factors > the data table will bot be convenient 
 e.g. to modelling change in the credit card interest rate 
 estimate the range of monthly interest rates from recent 5 years by (max apr-min apr)/12
 now current apr is 12.86 yearly = 1.07% monthly 
 in the previous time period, max/12, min/12 and then estimated monthly range (around from the current value)
 3. change multiple factors of the inputs
 use the tornado chart to find which one of the factor in fluentical most 
 
 
 ---------Senario analysis-------------
 >both quantitative and qualititive models 
 1. best case scenario 6000 assume 
 2. worst case scenario 4000 assume 
 (still use the what if analysis tool)
 1. best: maximum payment = (5000 from 1-12 and 6000 from 13)
 2. worst: maximum payment = (5000 from 1-12 and 4000 from 13)
 So, how ro adjust the base model for the scenarios?
 
 
 -----------find critical point----------
 target: if the client want to fully pay all the balances by the end of month 18, what would be the minimum monthly payment limit?
 still use the whatif analysis tool -- data table > goal seek 
 
 
  /////////calculus and optimization//////////////
 1. limit theory
 2. marginal change 
 3. differentiation/integration 
 
 >basic components of an optimization model 
 1. decision variables 
 2. objective functions 
 3. constraints
 
 > greedy strategy: not always offer the optimal solutions

 1. on limits and calculus 
 >basic concepts

 >use python as a clculus tool 
 2. optimization 
 >formulation of a problem by an optimization model 
 >develop optimization on spreadsheet

 ///////the rivision quiz following the chapter 3 ///////
 
 1. sample size determination 
 when estimating a population proportion (p), the user has decided to use take a sample to construct a confidence interval for p.
 suppose the maximum error of estimation (margin of error) can be relaxed by 10% from the original value. how dose it affect the minimum 
 required sample size satisfying the new product?
 >using the formula on the page 7 - 17%less 
 
 2. continue with question 1 
 instead of relaxing the maximum error of estimation, suppose the user decide to change the confidence level (confidence interval) of p 
 from 0.9 to 0.95. how does it affect the minimum required sample size?
 >42% larger than before 
 
 3. what if analysis 
 when exploring the impact of price and avaiable material on the (estimated) point, this analysis is most appripriately described as :
 > sensitivity analysis
 
 4. Calculas   
 what is the best description of the first and second derivatives of a given function f(x) with respect to variable x?
 >the first derivatives finds the rate of change of f(x)
 the decond derivatives finds shows whether f(x) is convex, concave or neither 
 inflection point: the first derivative at this point is 0 and the second derivative at this point is also 0

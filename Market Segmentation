## How to model portfolio optimization model?
Elective1: Mean-variance model > minimize the risk which > subject to expected return should be larger than the required lower limit 
Elective2: Mean absolute deviation model > minimize expected |portfolio return - average portfolio model| > subject to expected return should be higher than the limit
Elective3: Naive diversification > equally devide the budget among several risky options 


##case1 
Target: 
1. How to select one or more suppliers 
decide the purchase product of each supplier 
Constraints: 
1. administrative cost of 7000 for each of the suppliers. Total administrative cost 7000xnumber of suppliers 
2. for reliability, no supplier can sullpy more than 80% of the demand of any product 
3. must supply an integer amount of each product 
Objective: 
minimize(purchase + administration cost)


////////////////Data modeling and decisions under uncertainty///////
---------------what if analysis----------------
## how to make decision without complete information or have no informatin at all
 1. credit card payment 
 a. design your monthly payment strategy 
 b. develop a spreadsheet functions to simplify the banlance from one month to the next (base model)
 c. use spreadsheet functions to simplify the balance calculations from one month to the next
 [ending balance]= [current balance]x(1+monthly interest rate)-[payment]
 q: what is the total paymeny for the 24 months?
 
 >assume a base strategy > calculate the data using the base strategy 
 >now change the important input parameter (one more change)
 1. change the maximum monthly payment > use the data table (if more than 2 factors, not concenient/ simply recalculate outputs)
 2. change 2 main factors > the data table will bot be convenient 
 e.g. to modelling change in the credit card interest rate 
 estimate the range of monthly interest rates from recent 5 years by (max apr-min apr)/12
 now current apr is 12.86 yearly = 1.07% monthly 
 in the previous time period, max/12, min/12 and then estimated monthly range (around from the current value)
 3. change multiple factors of the inputs
 use the tornado chart to find which one of the factor in fluentical most 
 
 
 ---------Senario analysis-------------
 >both quantitative and qualititive models 
 1. best case scenario 6000 assume 
 2. worst case scenario 4000 assume 
 (still use the what if analysis tool)
 1. best: maximum payment = (5000 from 1-12 and 6000 from 13)
 2. worst: maximum payment = (5000 from 1-12 and 4000 from 13)
 So, how ro adjust the base model for the scenarios?
 
 
 -----------find critical point----------
 target: if the client want to fully pay all the balances by the end of month 18, what would be the minimum monthly payment limit?
 still use the whatif analysis tool -- data table > goal seek 
 
 
  /////////calculus and optimization//////////////
 1. limit theory
 2. marginal change 
 3. differentiation/integration 
 
 >basic components of an optimization model 
 1. decision variables 
 2. objective functions 
 3. constraints
 
 > greedy strategy: not always offer the optimal solutions 
 summary 
 1. on limits and calculus 
 >basic concepts 
 >applications 
 >use python as a clculus tool 
 2. optimization 
 >formulation of a problem by an optimization model 
 >develop optimization on spreadsheet 
 >use excel solver as optimization software
